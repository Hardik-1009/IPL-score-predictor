## üõ† Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and **transformed raw datasets** to ensure **high-quality inputs** for model training  
- Performed **data pre-processing** including handling missing values and encoding categorical features  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering
- **Engineered and selected relevant features** to improve **model accuracy** and **predictive performance**  
- Considered **match venues, team combinations, and match situations** as potential predictors  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Development & Evaluation
- Trained **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Decision Tree** models  
- Evaluated models using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R¬≤ Score**  
- Selected the **best-performing model** based on evaluation metrics  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment
- Built an **interactive web application** using **Streamlit**  
- Enabled users to **input match conditions** and **receive score predictions** in a **user-friendly interface**
